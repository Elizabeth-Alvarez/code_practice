To sharpen my coding skills I began working on simple and quick projects. I received inspiration from Jennifer Dewalt, who did 180 websites in 180 days (http://jenniferdewalt.com/), and followed her structure to gain confidence to work on a HTML5 keyboard game. The following three projects contain simple clicking requests.¥	Guessing_game¥	Canvas_painting¥	Random_bgI then moved on to work on a Super Mario Bros game imitation. I used a snake-making game tutorial (http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/html5-game-tutorial-make-a-snake-game-using-html5-canvas-jquery) to guide me in achieving the JavaScript key functions.In MarioStyle_game project, the intention is to use the keyboard arrows to guide the image throughout the screen. I have not finished this project but I have upload what I have done and will soon upload the finished product.(Update: Have not managed to get back to this project and complete it)
